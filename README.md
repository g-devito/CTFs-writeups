## Overview
This repository contains **writeups, methodology notes, and practice projects** from Hack The Box (HTB) challenges and other CTF platforms.
Its purpose is to **showcase practical cybersecurity skills** in reverse engineering, fuzzing, and vulnerability research.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Network & Web Enumeration**: Nmap, Gobuster, Burp Suite
- **Scripting & Automation**: Python & Bash helper scripts
- **Enumeration**: Service/user enumeration, SMB/LDAP fingerprinting, version discovery
- **Exploit Development**: PoC creation, Metasploit usage, basic buffer overflow/ROP prototyping
- **Lateral Movement**: SMB/WinRM/PSExec pivoting, credential reuse, relay/edge hopping techniques
- **Privilege Escalation**: Linux & Windows escalation (sudo misconfigs, kernel exploits, Kerberoasting)
- **Web Application Attacks**: SQLi, XSS, LFI/RFI, authentication bypasses and automated Burp workflows

## Methodology
Each writeup follows a **repeatable methodology** (extracted from the MITRE ATT&CK framework):
1. **Reconnaissance** – Gather information to map the attack surface.
2. **Resource Development** – Prepare and obtain tools and resources needed for the engagement.
3. **Initial Access** – Methods used to gain an initial foothold on a target.
4. **Privilege Escalation** – Actions taken to obtain higher privileges on a compromised host or environment.
